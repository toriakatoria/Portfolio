## About me
My name is Viktoriia Yevhrafova, and I've been a part of customers support team in iT company for more than 3 years for now.
As I've grown up from an average agent of Level 1 support to the Head of Customers Support, I've realised that I've acquired lots of Tester's knowledge due to my everyday tasks.
And later, managing support team and collaborating with other departments, I realised that QA is a very important link in product development cycle. 
So I've decided to dive in a bit deeper to explore it, and several months later here I am ðŸ˜€ - attending marathons, courses, reading tons of articles about testing and watching educational videos.
Ready to switch to the profession of a tester, as I'm really excited with it.


## My experience
I've had experience with manual regression testing at the current project where I'm working now. 
I perform this testing, actually it's a testing scenario, before each release. As my department deals with our clients' requests every day, I know exactly the correct behaviour of the system, and it's easy to recognise any malfunction at once.
Consequently, I report bugs found during testing and reported by our clients. Also, I take part in discussing future sprints with developers team and consult QA team.
